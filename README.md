## robots.txt smart package

Currently, all this package does is implement a <code>robots.addLine('line')</code>
which other packages can use to add lines to what is served at /robots.txt.  If you
also have a public/robots.txt that will be served from that location too, as normally.

If there is any demand for other functions, they can be added too.  Let me know
if you need to modify an existing robots.txt or want other functionality.
